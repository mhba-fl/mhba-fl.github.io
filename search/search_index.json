The nomination for the post of SPS President-Elect humbles me. If elected, I envision addressing the following priorities:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Serving our members: As we celebrate our 75th anniversary and look to the future, we can confidently say that our society's membership will look different and much more diverse than today's. Members in different geographical regions, industries, and career stages will have different needs and priorities. We will develop personalized activities and services around individual members' needs to the extent possible. For example, SPS will support activities that combine networking and mentoring programs with customized education and help build project-focused communities quickly for specific purposes. We will use enabling technologies, including webinars and virtual meetings, to establish and promote public forums, possibly free-of-charge ecosystems, to exchange ideas, data, and research artifacts, engage practicing engineers, and collaborate with industry leaders. We will intensify our investment and collaborate with IEEE and sister societies in offering services and solutions that address the educational and capacity-building needs of our current and future members by delivering micro-learning opportunities and \u201cstackable\u201d credentials in emerging interdisciplinary areas. With new technologies making the interaction among our members more convenient, we will continue expanding our networking and mentoring programs to more underserved areas and underrepresented groups in our community. Diversity and inclusion are our moral and ethical responsibility and necessary conditions for sustainable, long-range growth.</p> </li> <li> <p>Support to volunteers: SPS\u2019 governance structure ensures our goals and objectives are met. It should be future-focused and agile. We will expand our footprint and create new programs in emerging interdisciplinary areas such as data science, artificial intelligence, and machine learning. Moreover, as the submitted material is projected to increase, we will, in consultation with IEEE, experiment with partially automated initial vetting of submitted material while maintaining overall quality control at subsequent levels. Keeping our volunteers engaged and their workload reasonable while maintaining our reputation as a trusted knowledge source is feasible and doable.</p> </li> <li> <p>Securing the future: SPS finances our community\u2019s operations, offerings, and services to its members. Continuing to operate in a self-sustainable way is paramount for the long-term viability of our professional home. Dealing with the financial shortfall from the open-access initiative, accounting for the regional, membership-segment conference participation fee adjustments, financing new member services, and supporting membership-drive incentives impact SPS\u2019 fiscal profile. Still, some of our members\u2019 conference fees are high, and open-access publishing fees are unreasonably excessive given their circumstances, i.e., for those who transition between careers or are in a low-income region. That said, SPS\u2019s funding models do not need to be limited to membership subscriptions and conference and publication fees. In consultation with IEEE, we will explore income streams from sponsored activities, including support from corporate sponsors for conferences, public forums and special group activities, education and skills capacity offerings, monetization of applications related to \u201cinformation summarization,\u201d and \u201cexecutable knowledge.\u201d</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"bio_statement/#candidate-biography","title":"Candidate Biography:","text":"<p>KONSTANTINOS (KOSTAS) N.

It contains icons for websites and organisations related to academia that are often missing from mainstream font packages. It can be used by itself, but its primary purpose is to be used as a supplementary package alongside a larger icon set. Go here to view the full icon set along with instructions for their use.</p>"},{"location":"assets/images/academicons/#requesting-new-icons","title":"Requesting new icons","text":"<p>New icons can be requested by creating an issue here. Before submitting a request, please check that the following conditions are satisfied:</p> <ul> <li> <p>The organisation in question is already using a logo/icon of appropriate dimensions (roughly square). If that doesn't exist, then there's really not much that can be done, and the request will have to be ignored until such time that a logo/icon can be provided.</p> </li> <li> <p>An icon of appropriate resolution can be provided or linked to. Ideally, the provided file will be a vector file (e.g. SVG, EPS, AI) or a PDF with the vector file embedded. These files are all very easy to work with, and result in the most faithful reproductions of the icon. Altenatively, high resolution raster images (e.g. JPEG, PNG, GIF) can work, but only if the resolution is high enough that the underlying shapes can be reproduced. Icons made from raster images take much longer to prepare, and require hand drawing each component and figuring out the exact typeface used for any letters. This process can be rather tedious, and I will only do this if there is significant demand for the icon. Favicon files can be useful in conjunction with larger logos that have non-ideal aspect ratios\u2014where they can indicate which part of the logo to strip down to\u2014but they are pretty much useless by themselves. The only time I have made an icon from a favicon was for arXiv, and that was only because: (i) It was heavily requested, and (ii) I was able to get feedback on the new icon from Paul Ginsparg, who made the original icon. You can still submit the request, but it will likely be ignored until someone else comes along and provides the file we need.</p> </li> <li> <p>The icon can be reduced to monochrome. This is one of the basic requirements of a versatile icon, but it is often overlooked when icons are made by people who are not professional designers. Academia is full of unprofessional designers, and it is sometimes the case that a logo relies entirely on the use of different colours. In certain cases we can be creative (see the dblp logo), but more often than not it will be impossible to create a monochrome version of the icon. Again, feel free to make the request, but it will probably be ignored if an alternate logo cannot be found.</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"assets/images/academicons/#license","title":"License","text":"<ul> <li>The Academicons font is licensed under the SIL OFL 1.1:</li> <li>http://scripts.sil.org/OFL</li> <li>Academicons CSS, LESS, and SASS files are licensed under the MIT License:</li> <li>http://opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.html</li> <li>The Academicons documentation is licensed under the CC BY 3.0 License:</li> <li>http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/</li> </ul>"},{"location":"assets/images/academicons/#author","title":"Author","text":"<ul> <li>GitHub: https://github.com/jpswalsh</li> <li>Web: http://jpswalsh.com</li> </ul>"}]}
